NASHVIVA

  Nashviva is a mobile mapping app built using the Ionic framework. The finished app will use geolocation datasets contained in Nashville's Open Data Portal to map public resources, cultural sites, and utilities around Nashville.
  The app is currently in its early development stages. Version 1.0 will map public art pieces and installations so that they are easily accessible to the average Nashvillian. It will also allow users to create routes using those art pieces as waypoints, thus creating personalized "art crawls."
